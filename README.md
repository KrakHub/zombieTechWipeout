Mr Sekol deleted his third grading period classrooms for some reason, so I can't check the event checklist.

But for now, have an application that runs through python and can send emails to anyone. That's all for now I think.

# TODO for Alaina:
    Finish the UI you were making
    
# TODO for Roxanne
    Try and see if you can get video attachments working. Do your research for this (hint: try searching 'SMTP attachments')
   
   
ALSO, be sure to watch the video and use the resources in the classroom assignment if you need help with git. Any further help can be directed to me. https://classroom.google.com/u/1/c/NDgwNzcxNTQwMjAw/a/NDg0MDcxNjIxMjcx/details
